//COR//X
```
**15ITQ1V1T0240456E9** is the _MRN_; **X** is the customs status (eg. X, T1, T2, TBD).

> Note: in case the customs status is **TBD** (To Be Declared), the related data must e reported to the _Customs Agent_.

The Custom Agent will carry out the customs operation at the airport with the following syntax:

```
/IT/COR//TBD
///ST/..C..XYZ..C..
```

P.S: The custom agent field is a free text; by the way, to comply with the latest SEA SmartCity MXP guideline, the required value is the 3 digit SmartCityMXP Code.
