> BOOKING AND DELIVERY OF CARGO 

**Phase 3** concerns the classification of the truck loading process, the delivery slot assigned by the GHA and the shipment tracking status "at the airport".

By compiling the data related to phase 3, the delivery agent will be entitled to use a fast lane for the acceptance operations and the unloading of cargo. As a result, the GHA will be able to save time and reduce the effort of manual data entry. The Forwarder will be able to reduce the delivery times.

At the moment Phase L3 is under review, it will probably replaced by a dedicated APP end of 2023.
